# Neural Model for Intent Classification

In this repository one can find code for training and using the intent classification model
which is implemented as a shallow-and-wide Convolutional Neural Network[1]. 
The model is multi-class and multi-label, which means that each text in a dataset 
can belong to several classes.

We also have a pre-trained model for user intent classification for DSTC 2 dataset.
DSTC 2 dataset does not initially contain information about intents, 
therefore, `IntentDataset` (`deeppavlov/datasets/intent_dataset.py`) instance extracts 
artificial intents for each user reply using information from acts and slots.

Below we give several examples of intent construction:

> System: "Hello, welcome to the Cambridge restaurant system. You can ask for restaurants by area, price range or food type. How may I help you?"
>
> User: "cheap restaurant"

In the original dataset this user reply has characteristics
```
"goals": {"pricerange": "cheap"}, 
"db_result": null, 
"dialog-acts": [{"slots": [["pricerange", "cheap"]], "act": "inform"}]}
```
This message contains only one intent: `inform_pricerange`.

> User: "thank you good bye",

In the original dataset this user reply has characteristics 
```
"goals": {"food": "dontcare", "pricerange": "cheap", "area": "south"}, 
"db_result": null, 
"dialog-acts": [{"slots": [], "act": "thankyou"}, {"slots": [], "act": "bye"}]}
```
This message contains two intents `(thankyou, bye)`.

## Download pre-trained model

To download pre-trained models, vocabs, embeddings on DSTC 2 and SNIPS datasets one should run the following command:
```
python deep.py download configs/intents/intents_dstc2.json
```
or provide flag `-d` for commands like `interact`, `interactbot`, etc. The flag `-d` provides downloading all the required components.

## Infer from pre-trained model

To use a pre-trained model for inference one should run the following command:
```
python deep.py interact configs/intents/intents_dstc2.json
```
or
```
python deep.py interactbot configs/intents/intents_dstc2.json -t <TELEGRAM_TOKEN>
```
For 'interactbot' mode one should specify a Telegram bot token in `-t` parameter or in the `TELEGRAM_TOKEN` 
environment variable.


Now user can enter a text string and get output of two elements: the first one is an array of classes names (intents) which 
the string belongs to, and the second one is a dictionary with probability distribution among all the considered classes 
(take into account that as the task is a multi-class classification then sum of probabilities is not equal to 1). 

For example,
```
:: hey! I want cheap restaurant
>> (array(['inform_pricerange'], dtype='<U18'), {'ack': 0.0037632342, 'affirm': 0.015555085, 'bye': 0.01632652, 'confirm_area': 0.0035079047, 'confirm_food': 0.008698707, 'confirm_pricerange': 0.0065926723, 'deny_food': 0.0033183943, 'deny_name': 0.0032175593, 'hello': 0.007443315, 'inform_area': 0.27942947, 'inform_food': 0.041211434, 'inform_name': 0.0039961785, 'inform_pricerange': 0.5754329, 'inform_this': 0.02203026, 'negate': 0.011796405, 'repeat': 0.0034341915, 'reqalts': 0.017215012, 'reqmore': 0.002996667, 'request_addr': 0.051311377, 'request_area': 0.013899523, 'request_food': 0.0136800865, 'request_phone': 0.055341706, 'request_postcode': 0.0116683375, 'request_pricerange': 0.015019255, 'request_signature': 0.0032681762, 'restart': 0.0035573517, 'thankyou': 0.02431963, 'unknown': 0.04280461})
```

### Train on DSTC-2

To re-train a model or train it with different parameters on DSTC-2 dataset,
 one should set `save_path` to a directory where the trained model will be saved 
 (pre-trained model will be loaded if `load_path` is provided and files exist, otherwise it will be created from scratch).
 All other parameters of the model as well as embedder and tokenizer could be changed. 
 Then training can be run in the following way:
```
python deep.py train configs/intents/intents_dstc2.json
```

### Train on other datasets

Constructing intents from DSTC 2 makes `IntentDataset` difficult to use.
Therefore, we also provide another dataset reader `ClassificationDatasetReader` and dataset `ClassificationDataset`
to work with `.csv` files. These classes are described in `deeppavlov/dataset_readers` and `deeppavlov/datasets`.
 
Training data file `train.csv` (and `valid.csv`, if exists) should be in the following format:

| text         |intents|
|------------- |:-----:|
| text_0       | intent_0     |
| text_1       | intent_0     |
| text_2       | intent_1,intent_2     |
| text_3       | intent_1,intent_0,intent_2    | 
| ...          | ...   ||


To train model one should
* set `data_path` to the directory to which `train.csv` should be downloaded,
* set `save_path` to the directory where the trained model should be saved, 
* set all other parameters of model as well as embedder and tokenizer to desired ones.

Then the training can be run in the same way:
```
python deep.py train configs/intents/intents_snips.json
```

**The current version of `intents_snips.json` contains parameters for intent recognition for SNIPS benchmark dataset [2] 
that was restored in `.csv` format and will be downloaded automatically.**

**Important: we do not provide any special embedding binary file for SNIPS dataset.
In order to train the model one should provide own embedding binary file, because embedding file trained on DSTC-2 dataset is not the best choice for this task.**

## Comparison

As no one had published intent recognition for DSTC-2 data, 
the comparison of the presented model is given on **SNIPS** dataset. 
The evaluation of model scores was conducted in the same way as in [3] to compare with the results from the report of the authors of the dataset.
The results were achieved with tuning of parameters.

## How to improve the performance

* One can use FastText [4] to train embeddings that are better suited for considered datasets.
* All the parameters should be tuned on the validation set.
