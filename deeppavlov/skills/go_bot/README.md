# Dialogue Bot for goal-oriented task 
The dialogue bot is based on [[1]](#references) which introduces Hybrid Code Networks (HCNs) that combine an RNN with domain-specific knowledge and system action templates.

**Diagram 1.** Dotted lines correspond to unrequired (optional) modules, black squares to trained models, trapezes are modules that depend on a dataset and must be provided by software developer.

Here is a simple example of interaction with a trained dialogue bot (can be downloaded with [`deeppavlov/download.py`](../../download.py)):

#### Usage example

Available **pretrained for DSTC2 dataset** models:

  * model for [`deeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json`](../../configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json)
  * model for [`deeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2_best.json`](../../configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2_best.json)
  
To use pretrained model you should firstly **download it** (if you haven't done it already by `python3 deeppavlov/download.py -all`):

```bash
cd deeppavlov
python3 deep.py interact path/to/config.json -d
```

To infer from a pretrained model with config path equal to `path/to/config.json`:

```python
from deeppavlov.core.commands.infer import build_model_from_config
from deeppavlov.core.common.file import read_json

CONFIG_PATH = 'path/to/config.json'
model = build_model_from_config(read_json(CONFIG_PATH))

utterance = ""
while utterance != 'exit':
    print(">> " + model([utterance])[0])
    utterance = input(':: ')
```

To interact via command line use [`deeppavlov/deep.py`](../../deep.py) script:

```bash
cd deeppavlov
python3 deep.py interact path/to/config.json
```

## Training

To train model with config path `path/to/config.json` you should firstly **download** all the needed data (if you haven't done it already by `python3 deeppavlov/download.py -all`):

```bash
cd deeppavlov
python3 deep.py train path/to/config.json -d
```

The script will download needed data (dataset, embeddings) for the particular model.

#### Config parameters
To be used for training, your config json file should include parameters:

* `dataset_reader`
   * `name` — `"your_reader_here"` for a custom dataset or `"dstc2_v2_reader"` to use DSTC2 (for implementation see [`deeppavlov.dataset_readers.dstc2_reader`](../../dataset_readers/dstc2_reader.py))
   * `data_path` — a path to a dataset file, which in case of `"dstc2_v2_reader"` will be automatically downloaded from 
   internet and placed to `data_path` directory
* `dataset_iterator` — it should always be set to `{"name": "dialog_iterator"}` (for implementation see [`deeppavlov.dataset_iterators.dialog_iterator.py`](../../dataset_iterators/dialog_iterator.py))

See [`deeeppavlov/configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json`](../../configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json) for details.

#### Train run
The easiest way to run the training is by using [`deeppavlov/deep.py`](../../deep.py) script:

```bash
cd deeppavlov
python3 deep.py train path/to/config.json
```

## Datasets

#### DSTC2
The Hybrid Code Network model was trained and evaluated on a modification of a dataset from Dialogue State Tracking Challenge 2 [[2]](#references). The modifications were as follows:

* **new turns with api calls**
    * added api_calls to restaurant database (example: `{"text": "api_call area=\"south\" food=\"dontcare\" pricerange=\"cheap\"", "dialog_acts": ["api_call"]}`)

* **new actions**
    * bot dialog actions were concatenated into one action (example: `{"dialog_acts": ["ask", "request"]}` -> `{"dialog_acts": ["ask_request"]}`)
    * if a slot key was associated with the dialog action, the new act was a concatenation of an act and a slot key (example: `{"dialog_acts": ["ask"], "slot_vals": ["area"]}` -> `{"dialog_acts": ["ask_area"]}`)
* **new train/dev/test split**
    * original dstc2 consisted of three different MDP polices, the original train and dev datasets (consisting of two polices) were merged and randomly split into train/dev/test
* **minor fixes**
    * fixed several dialogs, where actions were wrongly annotated
    * uppercased first letter of bot responses
    * unified punctuation for bot responses'

#### Your data

##### Dialogs

If your model uses DSTC2 and relies on `dstc2_v2_reader` [`DSTC2Version2DatasetReader`](../../dataset_readers/dstc2_reader.py), all needed files, if not present in the `dataset_reader.data_path` directory, will be downloaded from internet.

If your model needs to be trained on different data, you have several ways of achieving that (sorted by increase in the amount of code):

1. Use `"dialog_iterator"` in dataset iterator config section and `"dstc2_v2_reader"` in dataset reader config section (**the simplest, but not the best way**):
    * set `dataset_iterator.data_path` to your data directory;
    * your data files should have the same format as expected in [`deeppavlov.dataset_readers.dstc2_reader:DSTC2Version2DatasetReader.read()`](../../dataset_readers/dstc2_reader.py) function.

2. Use `"dialog_iterator"` in dataset iterator config section and `"your_dataset_reader"` in dataset reader config section (**recommended**): 
    * clone [`deeppavlov.dataset_readers.dstc2_reader:DSTC2Version2DatasetReader`](../../dataset_readers/dstc2_reader.py) to `YourDatasetReader`;
    * register as `"your_dataset_reader"`;
    * rewrite so that it implements the same interface as the origin. Particularly, `YourDatasetReader.read()` must have the same output as `DSTC2DatasetReader.read()`:
      * `train` — training dialog turns consisting of tuples:
         * first tuple element contains first user's utterance info (as dict with the following fields):
            * `text` — utterance string
            * `intents` — list of string intents, associated with user's utterance
            * `db_result` — a database response _(optional)_
            * `episode_done` — set to `true`, if current utterance is the start of a new dialog, and `false` (or skipped) otherwise _(optional)_
         * second tuple element contains second user's response info
            * `text` — utterance string
            * `act` — an act, associated with the user's utterance
      * `valid` — validation dialog turns in the same format
      * `test` — test dialog turns in the same format

3. Use your own dataset iterator and dataset reader (**if 2. doesn't work for you**):
    * your `YourDatasetIterator.gen_batches()` class method output should match the input format for chainer from [`configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json`](../../configs/go_bot/gobot_dstc2.json).
    
##### Templates

You should provide a maping from actions to text templates in the following format (and set `template_type` to `"BaseTemplate"`, DSTC2 uses an extention of templates –`"DualTemplate"`, you will probably not need it):
  * `action\ttemplate`,
  * where filled slots in templates should start with "#" and mustn't contain whitespaces.
  
For example,
```txt
bye You are welcome!
canthear  Sorry, I can't hear you.
expl-conf_area  Did you say you are looking for a restaurant in the #area of town?
inform_area+inform_food+offer_name  #name is a nice place in the #area of town serving tasty #food food.
```

##### Database (optional)

If your dataset doesn't imply any api calls to an external database, just do not set `database` and `api_call_action` parameters and skip the section below.

Otherwise, you should specify them and
  1. provide sql table with requested items
or
  2. construct such table from provided in train samples `db_result` items. This can be done with the following script:

```bash
cd deeppavlov
python3 deep.py train configs/go_bot/database_yourdataset.json
```

where `configs/go_bot/database_yourdataset.json` is a copy of `configs/go_bot/database_dstc2.json` with configured `save_path`, `primary_keys` and `unknown_value`.
